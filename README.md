## Business Case

You are tasked with helping a real estate agency optimize their property pricing in Ames, Iowa. The agency has provided a dataset containing detailed house attributes and their corresponding sale prices. They aim to:

1. Identify key features that influence house prices.
2. Predict sale prices for their listed properties accurately.

With this solution, the agency will enhance its pricing strategy, ensuring competitiveness and maximizing profits.

## Dataset Content

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). It contains housing records from Ames, Iowa, providing detailed information about houses, including their size, quality, and additional features, along with their sale prices.

## Hypothesis and Validation

**Hypothesis:**

Certain factors significantly influence house prices, including:

- The overall quality and finish of the house.
- The total square footage and layout.
- The condition and size of essential areas like kitchens and garages.
- The construction year, as newer homes often command higher prices.

**Validation:**

Correlation studies and data visualizations will be used to validate these hypotheses. We will also analyze model performance metrics to assess prediction accuracy.

## Requirements Mapping

**Business Requirement 1:**  
- Explore correlations between house features and sale prices using visualizations.
- Summarize insights from high-correlation variables.

**Business Requirement 2:**  
- Build a machine learning model to predict house prices with a target accuracy of at least 75%.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the CI community 
- Huge thanks to Riman with her I would not have made it! link to her project (https://github.com/rimanfarhood/HeritageHousePrediction)
- This was probably the hardest project yet to grasp and understand
- It was hard to get help since I couldnâ€™t access a tutor for this project; I could only use Slack and my mentor, which felt underwhelming, making the process extremely challenging.
